How to fix Php 5.6 deprecated messages in Magento

I know, that Magento officially does not support Php 5.6, but as you may know, the latest version of Php (right now 5.6.1) comes with a lots of new features and optimizations, which could be handy. But those nasty deprecated messages “Deprecated functionality: iconv_set_encoding(): Use of iconv.internal_encoding is deprecated” fills Magento’s logs, right?
There is a temporary solution for this, simply we just have to override some core files of Magento (well, they are core Zend Framework files). Here are the steps to follow:
1. Create the following folders:
/app/code/local/Zend/Locale
/app/code/local/Zend/Service
/app/code/local/Zend/Validate
/app/code/local/Zend/XmlRpc

2. Copy the following files from /lib/Zend/ to /app/code/local/Zend/:
Locale/Format.php
Service/Audioscrobbler.php
Service/Technorati.php
Validate/Hostname.php
Validate/StringLength.php
XmlRpc/Client.php
3. Open the files from /app/code/local/Zend/ in a text editor and search for “internal_encoding” and replace them with “default_charset”. Before doing this, make sure that the “internal_encoding” string is a parameter of an iconv related function. Don’t replace “mb_internal_encoding”, “$internal_encoding” or any other non iconv related stuff, because it will break the code.

This solution is for Magento 1.8, but it should be very similar for 1.9 as well. If you are not sure, just search in all files for “internal_encoding” and do the three steps above for the needed files.

That’s all. Easy, isn’t it?
